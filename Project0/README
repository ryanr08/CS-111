For my smoke test I tested the script to try and obtain each of the 5 error codes
that the script would output. I tested an unrecognized argument and checked if the
exit code was 1. I passed in a non existant file and checked if the exit code was 2.
I passed in an outut file that has no write access and checked if the exit code was 3.
I passed in the --segfault and --check flags and checked if the exit code was 4.
I then passed in valid input and output files, checked if they were equal, and if the
exit code was 0.
